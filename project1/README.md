# Project 1 ETL data processor 
While looking for D&D related data sources, I stumbled upon Dan Keefe's project analyzing monsters in D&D (https://peritract.github.io/2020/05/14/dungeons-and-data/.) This project used the Dungeons and Dragons API. While his project was about analyzing monsters, I have made my project about the spells available in the game, as managing spell information can be difficult sometimes.

For the project, I need to:

- [x] Fetch / download / retrieve a remote data file by URL, or ingest a local file mounted.
    * For this project, I used the D&D Api to obtain the data set. This code is modified from Keefe's implementation of pulling the data


- [x] Convert the general format and data structure of the data source from JSON to CSV, from CSV to JSON, from JSON into a SQL database table, etc. There must be the option to convert any source to any target. So, if CSV is an input, I want the user to choose an output EXTRA â€“ Use and API (like twitter) to pull information realtime.
    * This code will pull the data directly from the API, and convert to the filetype requested by the user, depending on how the command is run. For more informataion, run `python3 etl.py -h`


- [x] Modify the number of columns from the source to the destination, reducing or adding columns. 
    * Added a column to indicate the source of the information for the API is from the SRD Ruleset (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd). This is a useful column to have in the event a user may want to combine this information with spells from other sources (Player's Handbook, Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, Homebrew content, etc.)


- [x] The converted (new) file should be written to disk (local file) or written to a SQL database. 
    * This is tied to the 2nd requirement
    - [x] CSV
    - [x] JSON
    - [x] SQL DB (currently converting all objects into strings, which is probably not the best way to approach this, but it works!)


- [x] Generate a brief summary of the data file ingestion including Number of records and Number of columns 
    * Simple print statement is made. As of current build, output should be `There are 319 records and 21 columns`

- [ ] Error handling
    * Some of it is done with the Arg Parse to help make sure enough information is there. Need to do one more pass to fill in any gaps i'm not seeing now.

## Other features that would be cool

- [ ] I want to provide an easy way to add custom spells, as well as spells from other source books still need to think on how this feature would work. This is beyond the scope of the project though.

- [ ] Querying spells so that information could be obtained and turned into an easy cheat sheet would be super nice.
